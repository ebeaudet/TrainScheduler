Train Scheduler

This app will allow you to track trains and arrival time. 

This app would be good for travelers that need to know when the next train to their location will be arriving so 
they dont spend too much time sitting around in the station.

You can start by entering the train departure location and the destination. You also log the next train time and the 
frequency and the app will calculate the next train departure.
